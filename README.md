## About this Organization

This organizations is where I fork any repository I'm currently working on. The idea here is to use Github's forking superpowers to allow me to work safely on any project without any danger. Here, you're going to find open source projects, company projects, and any repository I'm currently working one.

Repositories come and go from this organization. So, don't be sad if something you're looking for doesn't exist anymore.
